A self-taught artist, Chen staged underground exhibitions and guerrilla-style street performances during the period of martial law in Taiwan from 1949 to 1987. He stopped making art for eight years after the end of martial law. Chen returned to artistic production in 1996, and expanded his practice to weave in multiple narratives of Taiwan’s modern history, personal and familial experiences, globalisation, and collaborations with marginalised groups. His videos and film installations are characterised by a distinct aesthetic that often juxtaposes deliberately slow images with complete silence or concise dialogue as a method of articulating the notion of bodily experiences and memories. His work allows viewers to deploy their imaginations to fill in the gaps within the dialogue and, by such means, establish a mutual understanding. Chen has done solo exhibitions at prestigious institutions, including the Taipei Fine Arts Museum (Taiwan, 2010) and the Museo Nacional Centro De Arte Reina Sofia (Madrid, 2008). He was a recipient of the National Award for Arts from Taiwan’s National Cultural and Arts Foundation in 2009. He also received the Special Prize at the Gwangju Biennale in 2000.","陳界仁（1960年生於台灣桃園市）是一位國際知名的錄像藝術家及影片製作人，是台灣概念藝術的先驅人物。這位自學成師的藝術家，曾於1949至1987年台灣戒嚴時期進行地下展覽和於街頭進行快閃表演藝術。戒嚴時期結束後，他暫停藝術創作八年。1996年，他重新投入創作，並擴闊其藝術實踐領域，將台灣近代史、個人與家庭的經歷、全球一體化，以及與弱勢社群的合作經驗互相交織。其錄像和電影裝置風格獨特，影像刻意緩速播放，配合徹底的靜默或簡短的對白，藉此突出人物的形體感受和記憶。作品讓觀眾運用想像，填補對話之間的空白，從而建立互動關係。陳氏曾於多個著名藝術機構舉行個人展覽，包括2010年台灣臺北市立美術館的個展，以及2008年馬德里索菲婭王后國家藝術中心博物館的個展。他在2009年獲得台灣國家文化藝術基金會的國家文藝獎，以及2000年「光州雙年展」特別獎。","Male","男性",1960,,"Taiwanese"

Lee is a graduate of the department of fine arts at the Chinese University of Hong Kong and is one of the earliest Fotanian artists. Trained as a painter, Lee’s early practice included hand-painted cloths that were used in performances and his own mundane daily activities. His practice has since expanded to include paintings on cardboards, videos, audio recordings, and site-specific installations. His work explores the process of creation rather than the final result. It’s grounded on the quiet intensity of the human condition under a specific environment, which can be poetic, fragile, emotional, subtle, dynamic, indirect, private, or public. In 2013, Lee was selected as a finalist for the Hugo Boss Asia Art Award. That same year, he also represented Hong Kong at the fifty-fifth Venice Biennale. Lee currently lives and works in Hong Kong and Taipei.","李傑（1978年生於香港）主要從事裝置藝術創作。李氏畢業於香港中文大學藝術系，是最早在火炭設立工作室的藝術家之一。他在學時接受繪畫訓練，早期創作出一系列手繪布塊，融入個人日常生活和展覽之中，其後藝術實踐更擴闊至紙板繪畫、錄像、錄音及場域特定裝置。李氏的作品集中探討創造的過程，而非創作的成果；旨在呈現人類在特定環境狀況下一種安靜的張力，它可以是詩意的、脆弱的、情感豐富的、微妙的、力量充沛的、間接的、私人的、或公開的。2013年，李氏入圍Hugo Boss亞洲藝術大獎，同年代表香港參加第55屆「威尼斯雙年展」。李氏現於香港和台北生活及工作。","Male","男性",1978,,"Hong Kong"

Both artists studied oil painting at the Central Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing. Sun graduated in 1995 and Peng graduated in 1998. They are known for working with unconventional materials, such as human fat, live animals, and baby cadavers, to produce provocative works that tap into fear and anxiety to address compelling and complex issues of death, violence, and the human condition in today’s world. Sun and Peng have participated in influential exhibitions, including Post-Sense Sensibility : Alien Bodies & Delusion (Beijing, 1999) and Fuck Off! (Shanghai, 2000). They represent a generation experimenting body, sensibility and new media in the 1990s. Sun and Peng live and work in Beijing.","孫原（1972年生於北京）和彭禹（1974年生於黑龍江省佳木斯市）自1990年代後期便開始共同創作。兩位藝術家均就讀於北京中央美術學院油畫系，孫氏在1995年畢業，彭氏則於1998年畢業。他們以採用非傳統物料而聞名，如人體脂肪、活體動物和嬰兒屍體等，作品往往引發恐懼和焦慮等感受，並帶出一連串震撼而複雜的議題，如死亡、暴力和現今人類的處境。孫彭二人曾參與多個具影響力的展覽，包括1999年北京「後感性：異形與妄想」和2000年上海「不合作方式」。他們是1990年代以身體感知實驗及新媒體藝術創作的代表人物，現於北京生活及工作。","",,1998,,"Chinese"
