        "en": "Zhou Tiehai (born 1966, Shanghai) is known for producing conceptual works grounded on a critical attitude towards a self-absorbed art market. Zhou graduated from the College of Fine Arts at Shanghai University with a degree in painting in 1987. He works with a diverse range of medium, including painting, installation, and film. His works are infused with a clever mix of amusement, antagonism, and sincerity. Highly recognisable classical and historical images and pop culture references are key motifs in his work. These motifs act as an artistic agent to subvert and provoke a re-reading of the conventional conditions of the contemporary art world and the mechanisms of the global economy. Zhou works and lives in Shanghai.",
        "zh-hant": "周鐵海（1966年生於上海）以一系列概念作品聞名，其作品對自我膨脹的藝術市場抱持批判的態度。周氏在1987年畢業於上海大學美術學院，作品涉獵多種媒介，如繪畫、裝置和錄像，並巧妙結合幽默感、對抗意識和真摯的體會。他經常以著名的古典和歷史畫像，配合流行文化元素作主題，並透過藝術媒介進行顛覆，激發觀者重新解讀當代藝壇之因循俗套，以及環球經濟的運作體制。周氏現於上海生活及工作。"
