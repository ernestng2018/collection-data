        "en": "In 1995, Duan Jianyu graduated from the oil painting department at the Guangzhou Academy of Fine Arts. She is fascinated with the Western oil painting tradition, as well as the conventions associated with the discipline. Early in her career, she frequently painted subject matters that subvert both landscape and portrait traditions. By the early 2000s, her efforts to dismantle the dignified tradition of oil painting had fully developed into a new visual style that emphasises vulgarity and crudeness in rural scenes.",
