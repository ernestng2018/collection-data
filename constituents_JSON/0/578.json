        "en": "Zhang Jianjun (born 1955, Shanghai) graduated from the department of fine arts at the Shanghai Drama Institute in 1978. As an artist, Zhang steered avant-garde experimentation in Shanghai in the 1980s. He was known for producing abstract, black-and-white works using mixed media to address notions of existence, humanity, and nature. After moving to New York in 1989, his works began to reflect the rapid transformation of China’s urban landscape and culture, and also questioned the meaning of value and authenticity. Zhang currently lives and works in Shanghai.",
        "zh-hant": "張健君（1955年生於上海）1978年畢業於上海戲劇學院美術系，是1980年代上海前衛實驗藝術的先行者。他以混合媒介創作一系列黑白抽象作品，表達對存在、人性和自然的領悟。1989年移居紐約後，作品多探討中國都市風景和文化的急速變化，同時質疑價值和真實性的意義。張氏現於上海生活和工作。"
