        "en": "Fang Lijun (born 1963, Handan) graduated from the Print Department of the Central Academy of Fine Arts, Beijing, in 1989. He is a representative artist of Cynical Realism, a major art movement in China post-1989. His works capture the disillusionment of a generation after the Tiananmen Square incident and reflect the helpless mentality of Chinese society in the early 1990s. Fang lives and works in Beijing.",
