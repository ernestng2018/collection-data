        "en": "Xu Zhen (born 1977, Shanghai) graduated from the Shanghai School of Arts and Crafts in 1996. Since then he has produced conceptually-driven and controversial projects as an artist, curator, and founder of MadeIn, a company he set up in 2009 to collaborate with a group of artists and technicians. He works in photography, installation, video, and performance; his work contains a level of theatrical humour and criticises social conventions, reflecting the infinite possibilities of contemporary culture. Xu lives and works in Shanghai.",
